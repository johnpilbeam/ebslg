<h3>Membership</h3>
<p>Membership of the EBSLG is open to institutions in Europe that serve an accredited and world ranked MBA program or executive management course, offered at post-graduate or post-experience level. The EBSLG member libraries are divided into three regional groups: the UK and Ireland, Continental, and Northern European regional groups.</p>
<p>Membership is offered to an institutional representative, not an individual, and each institution is represented by one person who is normally the head of the business school library or information centre.  In the case of such programs that are not served by a separate business school library, membership is open to the manager or director responsible for managing the business collection or client services supporting the institution’s business programmes.</p>
<p>The member will hold a professional library qualification, or hold an equivalent level qualification in a discipline related to librarianship. The membership may be deemed to be vacant when the individual leaves the position. Members are each required to actively participate in the work of the group by contributing to discussions and joint projects, and by attending the annual regional meetings, and at least one annual meeting of the regional group, every three years.</p>
<p>Member libraries also have an opportunity to contribute by hosting the annual regional meeting on a rotation basis, and can further share their knowledge and views at the triennial joint conferences of the EBSLG-ABLD-APBSLG.</p>
<p>Members of the EBSLG commit to active participation by attending their annual regional meetings and by attending the annual conferences and AGM. Joint Triennial conferences with the APBSLG and the ABLD provide members with a rare opportunity to take part in the exchange of experiences and best practice with their counterparts on a global level.</p>
<p>Membership of the EBSLG is through application to the regional group coordinators, approved by Council, and then ratified yearly via the joint approval of the Group membership at the EBSLG’s Annual General Meeting. For further information, please <a href="/contact/">contact the regional coordinators</a>.</p>
