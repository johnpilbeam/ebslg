<h3>History</h3>
<p>The European Business Schools Librarians' Group was inaugurated in 1970 by several business librarians with the purpose of establishing a forum for the exchanging of experience and professional knowledge. From that beginning, the EBSLG has grown to become a pan-European forum for the directors of the libraries of leading European business schools. It is structured around three geographical regions with members belonging to one of the three regional EBSLG groups: a Northern European Group; a Continental Group and the Anglophone Group. Each of these groups meets once a year at one of the business schools or institutions within their region, and the combined EBSLG meets annually at a conference hosted, on a rotation basis, by one of the member libraries. The EBSLG is unique in Europe: its reputation and influence is enhanced by contacts with organisations, business schools and the numerous networks engaged with the supply, delivery and use of business information.</p>

<h4>The EBSLG – APBSLG and the ABLD</h4>
<p>In 2000, INSEAD played host to an historic first joint meeting of the EBSLG and the ABLD (The Academic Business Library Directors). This was followed by a second joint meeting of the US and European groups in Darden, Virginia in 2004. In 2007, following the 2002 inauguration of the APBSLG (The Asia Pacific Business School Librarians’ Group), a joint meeting of the three groups was held in May 2007 at the Copenhagen Business School.  Joint meetings of these groups have since been held every three years. The EBSLG also enjoys reciprocal engagement and conference attendance with members of CLADEA – a group representing Business Librarians of Latin America and institutions interested in the Latin American region.</p>
