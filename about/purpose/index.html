<h3>Purpose</h3>

<p>The purpose of the EBSLG is to provide a forum through which professional staff, engaged in the support of business schools or equivalent academic departments, can engage in a mutually supportive and dynamic way: through the EBSLG network, members can share best practice, raise and discuss topics of interest, and exchange information that can enhance the support services they provide their respective institutions.</p>
<p>Key to the effectiveness of the network are the annual regional meetings and EBSLG wide conferences at which members have an opportunity to focus on evolving challenges, trends, and opportunities for the development of innovative services; and to discuss projects and collaborative ventures that can bring mutual benefits to the membership, including statistical surveys, staff exchanges, benchmarking exercises, and the brokering of group-wide database deals with information suppliers.</p>
<p>A Year in Review keeps the members abreast of what is happening across the member institutions, while the EBSLG&rsquo;s controlled mail list ensures that members can be kept quickly informed of any critical issues that might arise and impact on their own libraries, and share an opportunity to air their own views or gather those of their colleagues, within a secure and mutually respectful collegiate environment.</p>
